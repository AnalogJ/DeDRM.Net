<p class="Firstpara"><span><span class="dropcap">“Y</span>ou shouldn’t be out of bed.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira winced, leaning heavily on the IV stand for support. “I’m fine.” She wasn’t, but she didn’t have time to lie around. Her time was up: Samm would be killed, the cure would be lost, Arwen would die, the entire island seemed ready to collapse in a cloud of rubble. Kira had a plan, and she wasn’t going to let a charred leg keep her from carrying it out.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The nurse shook his head. “You have a third-degree burn the size of a tennis ball. Let me help you back to your bed.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira held out her hand, favoring her burned leg as well as she could. “I’m fine, really. The regen box has already knit most of the skin back together, and there was barely any muscle damage. Just let me walk.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Are you sure?” the nurse asked. “You look like you’re hurting pretty bad.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I’m sure.” Kira took another step, using the IV stand as a cane and dragging her burned leg gingerly behind her. The nurse watched her, and she did her best to smile and look normal. In truth she felt horrible—she’d given herself a second treatment with the regen box, despite the risk of overdose, and the burned cells were only just starting to grow back. But she had to get up. She had to reach the Senate.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>They were nearby, she knew it. They were likely still using the town hall, as Mkele had suggested, but for a secret meeting of their Machiavellian subcommittee she knew they’d be here, in the hospital, hidden from the world and surrounded by guards.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She just had to find out where in the hospital they were.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The IV stand was on wheels, which squeaked softly as she limped down the long, white hallway. Every step was agony. She stopped at a nurses’ station, panting with exertion.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Are you okay, Kira?” It was Sandy, the maternity nurse.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I’m okay. Do you know where Dr. Skousen is?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Sandy shook her head. “He’s asked not to be disturbed.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Sandy, I know he’s in a meeting with the other senators,” Kira whispered. She watched Sandy’s face for a flash of recognition, saw it, and smiled inwardly. “It’s related to the secret project they’ve had me working on. I need to be there.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Sandy leaned toward her. “Look, I don’t want any part of this. They’re in the smaller conference room on four. Do what you need to do.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Thanks, Sandy.” She headed for the stairs as quickly as she could. <i>The fourth floor: ten steps up, turn a corner, ten more steps. Repeat twice more</i>. Kira gasped. <i>I’m never going to make it</i>. She shook her head, remembering Shaylon’s dying body, remembering Samm. <i>I have to find them. I don’t have any choice</i>. She gripped the handrail tightly, planted the IV stand on the first step, and slowly raised herself up. The wheeled stand wiggled slightly on the stair, but she held it in place. Every step hurt her leg, and soon her arms were exhausted from supporting so much of her weight. At the first landing she collapsed against the wall, her head resting on the plaster while she sucked in huge gulps of air. Her leg hurt more than she’d ever imagined anything could hurt, but she couldn’t stop. <i>They’re going to kill Samm</i>. She clenched her jaw and kept going, forcing herself to take the next step, then the next, then the next. Landing after landing. Floor after floor. When she reached the fourth floor she fell to the tile and crawled, until a soldier guarding the conference room ran to her side. It was the same guard from the last meeting, which meant he’d recognize her. Kira said a silent prayer of gratitude and hoped they hadn’t thought to tell him she wasn’t allowed in this time—why would they? They thought she was still bedridden.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Are you okay?” He lifted her to her feet. “They didn’t tell me you were coming.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span><i>Thank you</i>. She struggled to her feet, holding on to the soldier with one hand and her IV stand with the other. “I wouldn’t miss it. Help me in there.” She leaned on his arm and limped to the door, throwing it open with all the force she could muster.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Mkele and the senators were clustered around a table, Samm bound with chains in the corner. Everyone looked up at her in shock, and Kira could feel the hate in Kessler’s eyes like a laser. Delarosa merely raised her eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Hobb turned to Skousen. “You told us she was too injured to move.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Turns out he’s not actually a very good doctor,” said Kira, wincing and dragging her leg into the room. The soldier grabbed her shoulder, stopping her short.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I’m sorry, senators,” he said. “I didn’t realize. I’ll take her back.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“No,” said Delarosa. “She made it up here, the least we can do is listen to whatever she has to say.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We know exactly what she’ll say,” said Kessler.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Delarosa turned to the soldier with a stern glare. “Thank you; please wait outside. And if anyone else shows up, announce them before you let them in.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Of course, ma’am.” The red-faced soldier closed the door, and Kira glanced at Samm. He hadn’t been cleaned up since the explosion, and his clothes hung in filthy tatters. What skin she could see was riddled with scrapes and gashes, already healing but still obviously painful. He said nothing, but nodded curtly in acknowledgment.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She turned back to the senators, still panting from her exertion, and collapsed into a chair. “Sorry I’m late.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“This meeting does not concern you,” said Weist. “Your project has been terminated, we’re going to get rid of this … thing, and if we’re lucky, we might be able to clean up the mess.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“But the project is working,” said Kira. “I’m almost done mapping the development of the virus, and if I could just have a bit more time—”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“You’ve accomplished nothing,” said Skousen. “We risked the security of our city and the integrity of this council so that you could study a Partial, and when we need to see results all you can do is ask for more time?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“But now we understand—” said Kira, but Skousen was too furious to be stopped.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“You understand nothing! You say the virus has multiple forms: What triggers the change from one to another? Can we stop it? Can we bypass it? Can any of the forms be attacked or negated? Science is about specifics, Ms. Walker, not grand, helpless gestures of defiance. If you can give us a mechanism of change or a specific means of defense, then do so, but if not—”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Please, I just need more time.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We don’t have any more time!” shouted Delarosa. It was the first time she had ever raised her voice, and Kira quailed at the force of it. “Our city is falling apart—our entire island is falling apart. Voice attacks in the streets, bombs going off in the hospital, rebels fleeing the city and infiltrating our defenses and killing our citizens. We need to save some semblance of this civilization.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“You’re not listening to me!” said Kira, and the sound of her own words shocked her. “If Samm dies we all die, not today but inevitably, and there will be nothing we can do to stop it.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“This is an obsession,” said Delarosa. “A noble one, but still an obsession and still dangerous. We will not let it destroy the human race.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“You’re the ones who are going to destroy it,” said Kira, tears beginning to creep into her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I told you,” said Senator Kessler, “the same canned message every time.” She looked Kira over. “You sound exactly like Xochi, like the Voice, spouting this groundless, incendiary tripe.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira struggled for words, but they caught in her throat.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Your job is the future,” said Mkele softly. “Ours is the present. I told you before: If our goals ever conflict, ours takes priority. An organized Voice attack on East Meadow is imminent and there are only so many battles we can fight at one time. Before we do anything else, the Partial must be destroyed.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira glanced at Samm. As always, he was expressionless, but she could tell that he knew this was coming. She turned back to the senators. “Just like that? Not even a trial or a hearing or—”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“The hearing was four days ago,” said Weist. “You were there, and you heard the decision.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“You gave us five days of research,” said Kira. “We’ve only had three.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“The laboratory is destroyed,” said Skousen, “along with most of your work. You’re in no condition to continue, and there’s not enough data left for anyone else to finish what you started. Not in time.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Then move us to another laboratory,” said Kira. “Surely somewhere we have the equipment—all we need is the time. The five days was an arbitrary timeline in the first place.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“And risk further attacks?” asked Delarosa. “Absolutely not.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Hobb leaned forward. “The plan we’re considering will still allow for—”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Then let him go free,” said Kira suddenly. She swallowed, nervous, watching as their eyes grew dark and narrow. She plunged forward before they could protest. “He’s done nothing to hurt us, he’s even helped with the research. There’s no reason why we shouldn’t let him live.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Is this a joke?” hissed Kessler.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“It serves your purpose,” said Kira. “You want him gone: He’ll be gone. If nothing else, it will help alleviate the possibility of a Partial retaliation.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Skousen and Kessler scowled, and Weist shook his head. “Do you honestly think that will do any good?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Of course she does,” said Mkele. “She’s an idealist.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“She’s a plague baby,” said Kessler. “She’s developed an attachment to this thing, but she has no idea what the Partials are really like.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“And you do?” asked Kira. She tried to stand, gasped at the shock of pain, then rested back and turned in her chair. “You fought them eleven years ago—eleven years. Is it impossible to consider that something may have changed?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“You can’t believe anything it tells you,” said Mkele.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“He’s a soldier, not a spy,” said Kira. She turned to look at him; struggling, in this last moment, to decide once and for all if she could trust him. If he had been honest the last few days, or if he was really the monster the senators made him out to be.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>He watched her, outwardly calm and yet not quite concealing his nervousness, his determination. His hope. She looked back at the senators and spoke strongly. “Samm has faced captivity and torture by people who want to see his entire race destroyed, and he’s done it without crying, without complaining, without begging, without anything but strength and determination. If the other Partials are half as understanding as he is, we might just stand a chance—”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I’m on a mission of peace,” said Samm. His voice was firm and confident; Kira turned to him, tears forming again in her eyes as he stepped forward to the full reach of his manacles. The senators were silent. “My squad was in Manhattan because we were coming here, to talk to you. We came to offer a truce.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Lies,” snarled Kessler.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“It’s the truth,” said Samm. “We need your help.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span><i>But why?</i> thought Kira. <i>We can’t trust you if you don’t tell us why</i>.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>He looked at Kira for a moment, fixing her with his eyes, then turned to the senators and drew himself up, standing as tall and proud as he could. “We’re dying.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira’s eyes went wide; the entire room was shocked into silence.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Like you, we can’t reproduce, though ours is an engineered sterility built into our DNA—a fail-safe to keep us from getting out of hand. That never bothered us before because we don’t age, either, so there was never any danger of us disappearing. But apparently there’s a fail-safe for that, too.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Dr. Skousen regained his voice first. “You’re … dying? All of you?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We discovered ParaGen designed us with an expiration date,” said Samm. “At twenty years, the process that halts our aging reverses, and we shrivel and die within weeks, sometimes days. It’s not accelerated aging. It’s decay. We rot alive.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira’s mind reeled. This was the great secret he’d never dared tell—that the Partials had a ticking clock, just like the humans did. That’s why they wanted a truce. She was too shocked to move, but looked at the senators, trying to guess what they were thinking. Kessler was smiling, but Hobb and Weist were staring at Samm with shocked eyes and open mouths. Delarosa looked like she was trying not to cry, though Kira couldn’t tell if they were tears of joy or sorrow. Weist was mumbling under his breath, his mouth moving almost as if he didn’t realize it. Mkele was stone faced and silent.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“They’re dying,” said Kessler, and Kira nearly recoiled from the vicious glee in the woman’s voice. “Do you realize what this means? The first Partials were created in the third year of the Isolation War, which was … ten years before the Partial War. Twenty-one years ago. The first wave of them would have started dying last winter, and the youngest have what, two years left? Three at the most? And then they’ll be gone forever.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Everyone will be gone forever,” said Samm, and Kira felt more emotion in his voice, more earnestness, than she’d ever felt before. “Both of our species are going extinct—every sapient life form on the planet is going to die.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Our shelf life is longer than yours,” said Delarosa. “I think we’ll take our chances on our own.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you,” said Kira, finally finding her voice. “Without them there is no cure.” She looked at Samm, finally understanding his pleas. “We have to work together.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Samm nodded. “You can have babies, but they die of RM; we’re completely immune, but we can’t reproduce. Don’t you see? We need each other. Neither species can beat this alone.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Think what this will do for morale,” said Hobb. “Once the people hear this, they’ll … they’ll declare it a holiday. A new Rebuilding Day.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“What is wrong with you people?” Kira demanded, struggling to stand before collapsing heavily back into her chair. “He thought you’d kill him when you heard his secret, but it’s worse.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We were always going to destroy it,” said Mkele. “That was never in question.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“What this means now,” said Delarosa, “is that we’re going to do it in public, where this news can get out and do its job: unifying the human race.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Try to see the larger picture,” Hobb said to Kira. “You’re trying to save a group of people who are actively killing one another in the streets. Do you think a treaty with the enemy is going to change that? If they won’t even listen to us, what makes you think they’ll do anything for a Partial?” Hobb leaned forward, earnest and intense. “The Voice were calling for our heads long before the Partial showed up, and if word gets out that we’re hiding one, it will only get worse. The people are going to want answers; they’re going to <i>need</i> answers. And they need <i>us</i> to provide those answers, because when we provide them we’ll win the people back. We’ll have control of the island again; we’ll have peace again. We know you want peace.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Of course,” said Kira, “but—”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Be careful,” murmured Delarosa, looking not at Kira but at Senator Hobb. “What are you telling her?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“She can help,” said Hobb. He fixed Kira with eyes so deep and blue she felt herself caught by them, drawn in like water in a glass. “You’re an idealist,” he said. “You want to save people; we want to give you that opportunity. You’re also intelligent, so you tell me: What do the people want?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“They want peace,” said Kira.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Nobody blows up a building because they want peace,” said Hobb. “Try again.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“They want…” Kira watched Hobb’s face, wondering where he was going with this. <i>What do the people want?</i> “They want a cure.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Too specific.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“They want a future.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“They want a purpose.” Hobb spread his hands, gesturing grandly as he spoke. “They want to wake up in the morning knowing what they’re supposed to do, and how they’re supposed to do it. A future will give them purpose, and a cure will give them a future, but down at the core, the purpose is all they really want. They want a destination—they want a goal they can reach for. When we established East Meadow, we thought that the goal of curing RM would be enough. But it’s not a goal we’ve been able to reach, and over eleven years of fruitless nothing the people have fallen apart. Their purpose has withered and died. We need to give them something attainable—do you see where I’m going with this? We need to give them Samm.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“No!” shouted Kira.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Nobody knows who caused that explosion,” said Senator Delarosa. “It was probably the Voice, yes, but what if it was a Partial?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira felt the room grow cold. “It wasn’t.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“But what would it mean for humanity if it was?” Hobb licked his lips, gesturing with his hands as he spoke. “Humanity needs a purpose, and now this Partial has blown up our hospital.” He snapped his fingers. “There’s their purpose: an enemy! The people grow enraged—not against us, but with us. The island unites against a common foe. It might even sway the Voice—can you imagine what a coup that would be? All the rebels back on our team again, all this anger and violence directed out instead of in. The human race is tearing one another apart, Kira, but this will save it. Surely you can see that.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“But it’s a lie,” said Kira.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Because only a lie will save us in time,” said Delarosa. “I want a cure more than anyone, and yes, a real cure might unite us, but the clock has run out. The Voice have issued an ultimatum of civil war; the devil is at the gates. If we don’t do something now, tomorrow, we lose our chance to do anything at all.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>There was something wrong with their story—even beyond the obvious deception, there was something deeper and darker lurking somewhere inside. It made Kira queasy. “Why are you telling me this?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“This plan will work without you,” said Hobb, “but think how much better it will be with you. You’re young and pretty, you’re capable and idealistic, and you’ve been at the heart of everything we’ve done—you went to Manhattan and brought back the secret, you searched for the cure, and you were injured in the line of duty by the first Partial attack in eleven years.” He gestured at her leg. “If <i>we</i> tell this story, people will believe it; if <i>you</i> tell this story, people will die for it. You can make it personal and meaningful—you can be the hero who unites the world again. You’ll be the face of peace.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“This is evil,” said Kira. “You’re asking me to lie to everyone I know.” She pointed at Samm. “You’re asking me to be a part of his murder.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“The wolves are hungry,” said Delarosa. “We can kill ourselves fighting them, or we can throw them a body. The death of one Partial is the cheapest price for peace we could ever hope to pay.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>And then all at once, like a thunderbolt in her brain, Kira saw it—the deeper secret she couldn’t see before. The senators wanted to use this explosion to win back the Voice, but that would never work if the Voice had been the ones to set the bomb: They would know the Senate was lying. The only way to blame Samm was to use an event that no one knew the truth about, and that meant the Voice didn’t set that bomb.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>For the Senate’s plan to work, the bomb had to be set by … the Senate.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She almost shouted it out right there, accusing them without thinking, but for once in her life she managed to hold her tongue, biting down on the truth that she knew would get her killed where she stood. The Senate had set the bomb—the Senate had masterminded this entire thing from the beginning. They wanted to solve the Voice problem by creating a common enemy, and she had given them one; she’d dropped Samm right in their laps with her idiotic trip to Manhattan. That was why they’d brought him back, and that was why they’d put her in charge of the project—so that one day they could blow it all up without losing anyone important, and they could pose with the rubble and bring everyone together against the big, bad enemy they could never let go of. It was the same general plan they’d just explained to her, but deeper and older and far more sinister. They wouldn’t back out of it now, no matter how much she talked.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira looked at Samm—not just looked at him but stared at him, thought at him, <i>willed</i> him to understand her, wishing with all her being that she could link with him and breathe her thoughts straight into his brain. <i>I’m sorry</i>, she thought. <i>I can’t stop them. Please… I’m sorry</i>.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“It’s time for you to choose,” said Delarosa. “Join us, bring peace to the island, put an end to the Voice threat … or stay a rebel, and live your days as an exile. You could live comfortably on one of the farms.” She leaned forward. “You are a firebrand, Ms. Walker—people follow you, and if you join our cause, they will follow you into the brightest future we’ve seen in decades. A new dawn for humanity. The choice is yours.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span><i>I’m sorry</i>, she thought again. She gripped the IV stand, gritted her teeth, and dragged her charred leg one step back toward the senators. “There’s nothing I can do to stop you.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She could feel Samm’s shock like a wave of betrayal, slamming her in the back and washing up and over her head. <i>Just trust me</i>, she thought.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Hobb narrowed his eyes. “You’ll do it?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“No, I won’t.” She half turned, not daring to look Samm in the face again. “I can’t keep fighting you—look at me, I can barely stand up—but that doesn’t mean I’m going to sell him out to help you and lie to my friends.” A tear rolled down her cheek, but she kept her gaze firm, desperate for them to believe her. “Do whatever you have to do and be done with it. I won’t stop you.” She turned to the door, took a painful step, then paused, gasping for air. “And get one of your goons out there to carry me back downstairs. I can barely move anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Of course,” said Hobb. “Take your time. Recuperate. This will take us a few hours to set up anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira nodded. <i>That’s exactly what I’m counting on</i>.</span></p>
</body>
