<p class="Firstpara"><span><span class="dropcap">“W</span>e’re going to land near Mamaroneck,” said Samm. He squinted at the sky, then back at the distant shore. “I think.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The bay they had left was long and thin, and they didn’t dare to try the boat’s motor until the shores on either side fell away and the dark blue sound opened up around them. It worked fitfully, but it worked, and they headed north as straight as they could until the sky began to lighten and the featureless horizon became tinged with the green and brown of the mainland. They angled toward it, curving west. Kira hoped the motor would last until they got there; she was far too tired to row.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Mamaroneck?” asked Jayden. “That might actually be a sillier name than Asharoken.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Mamaroneck is a good spot,” said Samm. “It’s a little farther south than I’d like to be, but nobody’s stationed there. We should be able to land without being seen.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“How important is it that we aren’t seen?” asked Marcus. “These different factions—are we talking about differing movie opinions or full-scale holy war opinions?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“If they see us, they’ll attack us,” said Samm. “I’ll be imprisoned and used for leverage in one dispute or another, and I don’t know what they’ll do to you.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira looked up at the stars. “I take it not all the factions are as friendly as yours.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Mine isn’t especially friendly either,” he said quickly. “Just because they sent a peace proposal doesn’t mean they’ll open their arms to any human that walks in. Our disagreements with the other factions are … heated, and that’s made us cautious, and over time that’s made us suspicious. We still have to approach carefully.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“How can we tell the factions apart?” asked Xochi. “Do you have different uniforms, or… I don’t know, different-colored hats?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I don’t know if you can without the link,” said Samm. “My faction is called D Company, and most of us still wear that insignia, but honestly by the time you’re that close it’s probably too late. We’re talking about a war zone.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The motor cut out again, sputtering to a stop. Jayden stood up, yanking on the pull cord a few useless times, then hit it with a wrench and yanked again. The motor came back on with a sound even feebler than before.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Old gas,” said Jayden, throwing the wrench back into the bottom of the boat. “It’s either killing the engine or running out. Either way we’re going to end up rowing the last mile or two.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Who are we going to run into?” asked Kira, looking at Samm. “How much of a war zone are we talking about?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“The main group of rebels is north,” said Samm, “in a place called White Plains, and beyond that in Indian Point. They’re the ones who run the reactor.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Whoa,” said Xochi, “a nuclear reactor?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Of course,” said Samm. “How else would we get our energy?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Solar panels,” said Xochi simply. “That’s what we use.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“And it’s probably sufficient for your needs,” said Samm. “The nuclear plant in Indian Point used to power hundreds of millions of homes before the war—now that there’s not much more than a million of us left, it generates more than enough for anything we could ever need. The rebels maintain it. D Company found a way to tap into it a few years ago, and they still haven’t noticed.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“But nuclear power is dangerous,” said Xochi. “What if something happens? What if it leaks or melts down or whatever?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“A lot of them did,” said Samm. “When RM hit and the humans started dying—when you really started to disappear, and we knew there was nothing we could do to stop it—we found as many nuclear plants as we could and then shut them down safely. There’s another one in Connecticut, just sixty miles away from you guys across the sound.” He pointed to the northeast. “If that had gone into meltdown, you’d probably all be dead.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Right,” said Jayden derisively. “The noble Partials trying to save mankind.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Samm nodded. “Haven’t you ever wondered why the world isn’t more messed up than it is? Why the cities aren’t burning, why the air isn’t black with nuclear fallout? You died too quickly—some of you had time to shut off the power plants and the factories before you disappeared, but not everyone, and all it takes is one unattended reactor to cause a lethal meltdown. Even when we realized what was happening, we couldn’t shut them all down; we lost one in New Jersey, and another in Philadelphia, and more and more as you move west across the continent. That’s why we tend to stay east of the Hudson. Other parts of the world had even more reactors than we did, but without an army of Partials to step in and stop them, we think a lot more of them may have gone critical. Maybe as many as half.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Nobody spoke. The coughing buzz of the motor filled the boat. <i>We always wondered if there were more survivors</i>, thought Kira. <i>The RM immunity would have left the same percentage alive in other countries that it left in ours</i>.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span><i>Is it really possible that everyone else is dead?</i></span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“The question about what to do with you is what eventually split us apart,” Samm continued softly. “Some wanted to just finish you off, but most of us, like I said, wanted to save you. Even then, we couldn’t agree on the best way to do it. The arguments grew … heated. To say the least. And then the first wave of our leaders started dying, and it all fell apart. D Company is practically all that’s left of the truly obedient Partials—the only ones with a direct link to the Trust.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“And what’s the Trust?” asked Kira.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“The senior command,” said Samm, “the generals of the Partial army, and probably from advanced genetic templates, because none of them have died. Well—none of them have died from an inherent expiration date. There were eight of them, men and women, but I think the rebels may have killed two, or at least captured them.” His voice changed as he said this, and his expression grew dark. “It was the Trust that told D Company where to make our base, and when to approach the humans.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I’m getting the impression that D Company is relatively small,” said Marcus. “That’s wonderful—we finally form an alliance, and it’s with a persecuted splinter group just as messed up as we are. This’ll make the rest of the Partials even more determined to kill us.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The engine died again, and this time no amount of yanking and beating and swearing could get it running again. Samm and Marcus took the first turn at the oars, pulling hard toward the shore, and soon the green line became dotted with white: a wide harbor filled with boats. They reached the first line in just half an hour: large yachts anchored far from shore, covered stem to stern with seagull droppings. Kira wrinkled her nose in disgust.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I was hoping to trade up for a new boat, but these are unusable.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“They’re too big anyway,” said Samm, stowing his oars as their boat bumped gently against the stained hull of another. “We can’t row them, and I assume none of us knows how to sail.” They shook their heads. “At the very least we can stop and look for supplies.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Okay,” said Kira, “but not this one. I don’t want us getting … bird flu, or bird diarrhea, or whatever that stuff will give you.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Samm nodded.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>They rowed to the next boat, then the next, working their way farther into the harbor until finally finding a yacht that looked clean enough to board—still filthy, but not as bad, and their options were running out. They maneuvered around to the back, where the name <i>Show Me the Money III</i> was emblazoned across it in faded letters. Marcus gripped the stern while Samm climbed aboard.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“The rest of you wait here,” said Samm. He climbed over and descended into the depths of the yacht, and Marcus leaned close to Kira.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“What do you think?” he whispered. “Do you still trust him?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“He hasn’t done anything to change my mind,” said Kira.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Not directly, no,” said Marcus, “but that story was… I don’t know. It’s a lot to take in.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“At least it’s plausible,” said Jayden. “We’ve always wondered why the Partials turned around and left eleven years ago, and why they’ve never attacked us since. If they’re too busy fighting one another to bother with us, that makes a little more sense.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I’m still suspicious,” said Marcus. “Something about this place doesn’t feel right.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Samm emerged with an armload of objects from the yacht. “Bad news,” he said. “According to the boat’s harbor papers, we’re in Echo Bay, not Mamaroneck, which means we’ve gone a lot farther west than I thought. There’s a map here that should help us get back on track.” He handed the items down to Kira, who took them carefully into their boat: a map, a pair of binoculars, a deck of cards, and a pile of clothes and blankets. “I haven’t had a change of clothes since you captured me,” said Samm, stripping off his rumpled uniform. “Plus this yacht is filthy.” Kira couldn’t help but stare at his chest and arms, more chiseled than she would have expected after two weeks of being tied to a chair. She looked away after a second, feeling foolish, while Samm stripped down to his underwear and dove into the water. Marcus glanced at Kira, giving her his <i>You can’t be serious</i> look, but Xochi watched the athletic Partial surface with obvious appreciation. He climbed back into their boat, dried himself as best he could with a blanket, and slipped into a new set of clothes.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira unfolded the map, searching the sound for Echo Bay. “You’re right,” she said. “This is a lot farther west than I thought. Where is D Company?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Samm looked over her shoulder, pointing at a spot along the coast. “Greenwich; like you, we built our city around a hospital. Looks like it’s about twelve, thirteen miles away.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“That’s not bad,” said Jayden.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“It’s not,” said Samm, “but that route goes through rebel territory, here.” He pointed at a spot about halfway along. “We could search for another boat and try to skirt the coast, but I don’t recommend it. Our engine barely made it here, and I think there’s a storm coming.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I don’t exactly want to travel through enemy territory, though,” said Kira. “We won’t be able to hide, thanks to your link—as soon as they get close, they’ll know exactly where you are.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Also true.” Samm nodded.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We’ve still got gas,” said Jayden, checking the engine. “That means the problem’s with the motor itself.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Then let’s find a new boat,” said Kira. “The longer we can go before walking, the better. Our nine-mile run last night almost killed us.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>They rowed through the harbor, searching for a boat they could handle, and finally found one docked on the side of a much larger yacht—a lifeboat, maybe, or a backup designed for emergencies. Samm climbed aboard, peeled off the cracking canvas cover, and fired up the motor. It started on the fourth try and purred much more evenly than their first boat. He and Marcus and Jayden managed to unhook it from the yacht and dump it into the water, and then the five travelers transferred their gear from one boat to the next. It was much smaller—a rowboat with a motor, not the fancy motorboat they’d been riding in thus far—but it held them, and the engine worked, and Marcus steered them back out of the harbor and north toward D Company.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Farther out from the shore,” said Samm. Marcus steered away from land, deeper into the sound, and Samm watched the shore with nervous eyes. “Farther.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Too much farther and we can’t see the shore at all anymore,” said Marcus. “We’ll get lost again.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I can see the shore just fine,” said Samm. “Which means anyone on the shore can see us. Go farther.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Marcus frowned and glanced at Kira, but steered farther out into the water. The mainland was a distant line on the horizon now, barely even visible. Samm watched it intently, giving Marcus minor course corrections when necessary. Kira and Xochi and Jayden lay in the bow, draped uncomfortably over the fiberglass benches, trying to get some sleep.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>It was Marcus who first spotted the storm.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“How long have we been out here?” he asked, his hand still guiding the rudder. “Is the sky supposed to be that dark this early in the morning?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Wind’s picked up as well,” said Samm. “It’s cooler than it was a few minutes ago.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I’ve seen a few of these sound storms from the shore,” said Jayden, sitting up. He looked worried. “They get pretty heavy out here, or at least it always looks that way.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I’ll turn toward shore,” said Marcus, but Samm stopped him.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We’re passing rebel territory right now,” he said, looking at the map and then peering back out to the north. “It’s not safe.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Have you seen the sky?” asked Marcus, pointing to the thick gray clouds. “That’s not exactly safe either.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“This boat barely fits us,” said Kira. The water was choppy now, bucking the boat gently as they plowed forward through the waves. “If it gets too rough out here, we’ll flip right over.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We can’t go in,” Samm insisted. “It’s too dangerous.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Then everybody hold on,” said Marcus. “This is about to get a lot more exciting than we’d planned for.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The storm raced toward them, and they to it; Kira felt fat drops of rain on her face, mingling with the salty spray of the sea. They pulled out their blankets and cowered under them for shelter, but the rain seemed to be coming almost horizontally with the wind. The sky grew dark above them, an eerie half-light, and the small boat started rolling with the waves.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I’m going closer to shore,” said Marcus, turning the rudder before Samm could protest. “It’s impossible to see in this storm anyway—no one’s going to spot us.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The storm grew worse, the drops giving way to thin, slashing knives of rain. Kira gripped the side of the boat tightly, holding on to Xochi with her other hand, certain that each new wave would be the one to dump them over the side. She was soaked to the bone. It was nearly as dark now as it had been last night.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Get us closer to shore,” she shouted to Marcus, grabbing Xochi’s arm even tighter as another wave lurched the ship up and sideways.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I’m going straight toward it already,” shouted Marcus. “Or at least I was last time I could see it. I’m just afraid the ocean’s trying to turn us around.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We’re too heavy,” shouted Jayden. “We have to lighten the load.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira tossed her backpack over the side, keeping her guns and strapping her medkit tight around her shoulders. Xochi dug through her bag and Marcus’s, salvaging what ammunition she could, then threw the rest over after Kira’s. The boat rocked violently until it seemed to Kira that they were being tossed around almost at random. She had no idea what direction they were pointing, or where they were going, when suddenly a giant rock appeared through the rain ahead of them. Marcus swore and turned to the side, trying to miss it, but another wave of rain slashed down and covered it again, plunging them back into the same gray chaos as before. She thought she saw a tree to her left—a tree, in the middle of the ocean—but it disappeared so quickly she couldn’t be sure. <i>We must be near the shore</i>, Kira thought, <i>it’s the only explan—</i> and then a giant white shape loomed out of the water beside them, slamming into them with a boom that nearly tipped the boat. It was another yacht, straining against its anchor before being pulled back under the waves. A surge of water picked them up, nearly throwing them through the air, and Kira heard herself screaming, felt herself choking on rain and seawater splashing up from over the side. Water sloshed madly in the bottom of the boat, but they were still upright.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Hold on!” she shouted, useless and obvious, but she felt powerless and had to say something. The wind roared in her ears and blew mad shapes through the rain around them. Another yacht reared up, missing them by half an arm’s length, and then they were once again lost in the roiling limbo of the open sea.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Marcus was shouting, but she couldn’t hear the words. He pointed, and she turned to look; the rain was so fierce she could barely see, squinting her eyes almost shut to keep out the rock-hard pellets of rain. She saw it too late, but doubted there would be anything she could have done anyway—a massive black wave, as high as building, crashing toward them from the side. She had just enough presence of mind to take a breath and hold it, and then the wave struck and the world went away.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext" style="margin-bottom:1em;"><span>Space became meaningless—there was no up or down, no left or right, just force and pressure and acceleration, ripping her through a cold, seething nothingness. She lost her grip on Xochi’s arm, then found it again, clinging desperately to the only solid thing in the universe. The wave carried her farther, dragging her through the formless void until she thought her lungs would burst, and suddenly she was in the air, tumbling. She took a breath just in time to hit a wall of water and have it knocked out of her again. She held fiercely to the arm, never letting go, irrationally certain that it was the only thing keeping her alive. The second wave passed and she bobbed up from the water, sucking in a long, desperate breath half mixed with seawater. She choked and breathed again. Another wave crashed down, and she was gone.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span>Rocks. Heat. Kira woke with a start, trying to get her bearings, disoriented by the sudden change from angry ocean to solid ground. She coughed, spitting up slick, salty water.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“You’re alive,” said a voice. Samm. She looked around, finding herself in some kind of marsh next to a low rock wall. Samm knelt against it, looking out with the binoculars. Beyond the wall, the sea lay still and placid.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We’re on land,” said Kira, still trying to process the situation. “What happened?” She looked around in sudden panic. “Where are the others?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Over there,” said Samm, pointing across the water. Kira crawled toward him, her legs too weak to stand, and clambered up to lean against the wall. “The big building, just to the right,” he said. He handed her the binoculars. “I wasn’t sure it was them at first, but it is.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira searched for the big building he’d pointed to, then looked to the right, probing slowly across the landscape. She saw movement and snapped onto it, looking carefully: three people. She couldn’t see them clearly, but she was fairly certain she recognized their clothes.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We’re all alive, then,” she said, staring at the one she thought was Marcus. “I grabbed someone underwater. I thought it was Xochi.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“It was me,” said Samm simply, still scanning the horizon.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira crouched next to him. “What is that, an island?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“The other side of the bay,” said Samm. “It looks like the storm dropped us right where we needed to go—though obviously in two separate groups. I guess we can’t complain too much.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“This is Greenwich?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Close enough,” said Samm. “If I’ve got our location right, your friends are actually closer than we are.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We need to signal them,” said Kira. “They keep looking out to sea—they don’t know we’re over here.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Too dangerous,” said Samm. “Even if you could shout that far, any Partials in the area would hear you first and get to us first as well.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We can’t just let them wonder.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“If they’re smart, they’ll head inland, looking for anything that can tell them where they are. We can go up around the bay and find them.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We can find another boat and row over there—”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“No we can’t,” said Samm firmly. “This is close to Greenwich, but it’s south, and that means rebel territory. They watch these waters, looking for D Company—the only reason they didn’t see us come in was the storm concealing us. If we row out across the bay, we’ll be spotted for sure.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Then won’t they be spotted as well?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Not if they wise up and get out of the open,” said Samm. “They’re actually safer here than we are—I’ll automatically link to any other Partials in range, but you humans are effectively invisible. No one expects to find humans on the mainland, so we don’t look for them; we rely too heavily on the link. If those three stay smart, they can move through the entire area without being caught.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Great for them,” said Kira, still watching her friends through the binoculars. “How are we going to get past the rebels?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Samm held up a waterlogged blanket, one of the ones they’d found in the old yacht, and started ripping it into strips. “The link data is transmitted primarily through our breath. If I cover my mouth and nose tight enough, I should be able to mask my presence. A little.” He frowned.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Are you going to be able to breathe?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“That’s why this isn’t a perfect solution,” he said. “A gas mask isn’t perfect, but it’s much better. I don’t know how much the rebels know about the mission we launched in Manhattan, but it’s conceivable that things have escalated, and if so, that’s what their scouts will be wearing. They’re the ones we’ll have to be careful of, because I won’t know they’re coming until it’s too late.” He wrapped the wet black cloth around his face, covering his mouth and nose and tying the ripped blanket tightly behind his head. He took a deep breath, trying it out, then tied another strip over the first to give it more grip.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“This should work for a while.” His words were muffled, only barely discernible. Kira nodded and followed him back through the grounds of an old manor house, wishing she’d managed to keep hold of her guns in the shipwreck. She didn’t like the prospect of meeting other Partials without them.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The manor house turned out to be on a small, rounded promontory, connected back to land by a series of narrow asphalt lanes. They crossed each one at a run, crouching low and then ducking behind the nearest spray of foliage, looking for signs that they’d been spotted. If there were other Partials watching, they kept themselves hidden. Kira looked back across the harbor whenever she could, hoping to catch a glimpse of her lost friends, but they were hidden as well. She doubled her pace, desperate to round the harbor and find them before they wandered too far away.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Samm led her through a small shipyard, full of dry, cracking boats and rusted tracks leading down into the water. Beyond that was an old park, overgrown with trees and kudzu, yet originally big enough, Kira estimated, to have made for a series of good-size cornfields. It surprised her that the Partials hadn’t planted it, but she supposed a war zone wasn’t the best place, and this was, as she understood it, the outskirts of the Partial civilization. Perhaps all their farms were farther north? Or did they get food by some other means she couldn’t guess at? It bothered her, suddenly, how little she really knew about the Partials: Here she was, in unknown territory, trusting the enemy she’d been raised to hate. The reason she was an orphan. The reason she’d learned to fire a gun at eight years old.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span><i>Do I really know what I’m doing?</i></span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Samm led her away from the water’s edge, into the wooded park where they’d be harder to see. He moved quickly but carefully, his eyes darting back and forth, examining not only their flanks but the ground and the trees above them. Kira fell into rhythm beside him, watching for ambush, avoiding fallen branches. They passed a funeral home, and she studied it solemnly. Death seemed to hover in the air.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Beyond the trees they came to a highway, flanked on the far side by another row of thick trees. It cut through the forest like a hallway, and Samm peered down it in both directions—flat to the west, and climbing a small hill to the east. “We’ll make better time on this than next to it,” he said. “It doesn’t take us through the town, just around the edge, so there might not be anybody watching.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Will it take us to Marcus and the others?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“They’ll have to cross it, too.” Samm nodded. He pointed toward a curve in the road, far to the east. “That’s the end of the peninsula, if I’m remembering correctly. If they haven’t already crossed, we can catch them there.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>They ran quickly, making up for lost time; the highway was raised, with extra layers of asphalt between it and the dirt below, and nothing had managed to grow through. No one crossed their path, ahead or behind them. Soon the road began to rise, and Kira realized with shock that the rest of the country wasn’t rising with it—it wasn’t a hill, just an elevated road. Smaller roads began passing underneath it.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Stop,” she said. “We may have already missed them.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I was thinking the same thing.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We need to find them.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We’re almost to the base now,” said Samm, shaking his head. “We should go straight there and then send out a search party—they’ll find your friends better than we can.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Unless someone else finds them first,” said Kira. She looked out from the elevated road, trying to see through the gaps in the trees below. “We can’t just leave them out here for the rebels to find.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I don’t think they will,” said Samm, tapping his face mask. <i>The link</i>.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Then you go,” said Kira, “and I’ll look for Marcus. Your search-and-rescue team can find me just as easily as they can find them.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We can’t split up again,” Samm insisted. His voice was low, barely audible through his makeshift mask. He seemed jumpy for the first time, and Kira felt herself grow nervous at the sight of it.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She heard the roar of an engine, a distant echo through the trees, and she went pale.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“You use cars, too?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Electric, mostly, but yes. There’s an oil refinery farther north.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira glanced up and down the highway, trying to pinpoint the sound. “Behind us?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I think so.” He started jogging forward. “We have to run.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We don’t have time,” said Kira, peering over the edge of the sidewall. It was at least twenty feet down, but the trees were crowded close, and she thought she could reach one. “We need to climb down.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We can’t go down,” said Samm fiercely, rushing back to grab her arm. “We have to move forward.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“The engines are getting closer, we don’t have time to—”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“There are rebels down there,” he whispered urgently.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira dropped to her knees, crouching behind the wall. “You’re linking with them?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I can’t help it.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span><i>Which means they know we’re here</i>. Kira stared at him, studying his eyes. <i>We don’t have weapons. We can’t fight. The enemy already knows we’re here</i>.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span><i>Do they know my friends are here as well?</i></span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“How close?” Kira whispered.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Samm grimaced. “It’s not that precise when it’s muffled like this, but I can tell they’re close. Seventy, eighty yards.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“That’s pretty precise,” said Kira. “You think they heard us talking?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Sam shook his head. “They’re on alert, but it might not be for us. We have no way of knowing until they’re closer, and then if we’re wrong, it’s too late.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira punched the concrete with the side of her hand, swearing under her breath. <i>I’m not going to let them get captured</i>. She took a deep breath, shaking her head at her own stupidity, and stood up. “We’re going down.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We can’t go down.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She jogged to the spot with the closest tree, looked at the underbrush two stories below, and clambered onto the sidewall. Samm pulled her back, and she shook him off. “I’m not leaving my friends,” she said firmly. “You can either come with me or go for help.” She climbed back up, balancing carefully, and tried to gauge the distance. <i>Seven feet. Maybe ten. That’s long for a standing jump, but I’ll get extra distance as I fall</i>.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span><i>Which is not very encouraging</i>.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Don’t do it, Kira.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She jumped.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She kept her hands wide and wrapped her arms around the biggest branch she could, catching it with her elbows and swinging wildly beneath it. The tree caught her as she caught it, and the rough branches dug sharply into her skin and clothes. The tree shook with a second shudder, and she saw that Samm had followed her. She smiled. “Thanks.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“You’re crazy,” he muttered.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“That’s what everyone keeps saying.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>They climbed down quickly, hearing the roar of the engine grow louder and louder. The sound split as it neared, becoming two engines, then three, then four. Kira dropped the last few feet to the ground and raced into the underpass, crouching in the shadow of a thick concrete pillar. Samm threw himself down beside her, and they listened as the cars rumbled overhead, streaking away to the east and slowly fading into the distance.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira whistled. “That was close.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Not as close as it’s going to be,” said Samm. His voice was stiff and strained.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Are you hurt?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“No,” he grunted, “just … what’s your plan?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“They can’t sense me coming, right? So I’m going to jump one from behind and take his gun.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“They can’t sense you on the link, Kira, but that doesn’t mean you’re invisible.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“How much can they sense from you?” she asked. “Thoughts? Motive?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Not exactly,” he said, “more like health, proximity, emotional state. Things like that. I won’t be able to glean anything from them that would help you grab one.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I don’t want you to read their minds,” said Kira, looking out at the wide, tangled lawn. “I want you to be bait.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Whoa.” He held up his hand. “Are you serious?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“It’s okay,” she said. “I’ll stop them before they hurt you.” She grinned. “You said they rely too much on the link, right? So if the link tells them there’s a Partial hiding around one corner, they won’t even bother to look around the other.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>He shook his head. Kira could see that his breathing was accelerated; his face twitched and scowled. “As soon as you jump one, the link will tell the others he’s in trouble.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Then we hit fast and be gone before they show up.” She pulled him farther behind the pillar. “I know it’s dangerous, but my friends are in the same danger—worse, even, because they don’t have you.” Her voice softened. “We can do this.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“That’s great,” said Samm, “but you’re talking about finding a scout trained and equipped to avoid being found. It’s not going to happen.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Keep your voice down,” Kira whispered. “It already has.” She gestured around the edge of the pillar, and Samm carefully peeked out. He ducked back and pressed his mouth to her ear.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Forty yards out.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“He probably heard us fall out of the tree,” Kira whispered. “I don’t think he’s seen us yet—he’s not trying to hide, just checking something out.” She pointed to the far side of the underpass. “You crawl over there. He’ll see you and walk right past me.” Samm seemed nearly rigid with tension, like he was clenching every muscle in his body; he’d been like that for a while. <i>The other Partial’s too close</i>, she thought. <i>I don’t have time to see if he’s injured</i>. “Are you sure you’re all right?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Fine,” he grunted. He turned and crawled through the underbrush, working his way to the far pillar, then across to the next in line. Kira nodded, impressed at the tactic. <i>This way the rebel scout won’t pass as close to my pillar</i>, she thought, <i>so he’ll be less likely to look behind it</i>. Samm moved stiffly, almost painfully, and she wondered again if he’d hurt himself in the jump to the tree. <i>But no—he was already acting strange on the road above. What’s going on?</i></span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Hold it,” said a voice, and Kira was shocked to hear that it was female. She froze in place, hoping her plan had worked and the Partial wouldn’t notice her. Samm stopped as well, pausing on his hands and knees in the thin weeds below the bridge. He didn’t speak. Kira heard footsteps behind her, to the side, then held her breath as the Partial walked past in a straight line toward Samm. Seen up close she was obviously female: thin in the waist, round in the hips and chest, a bun of jet-black hair done up behind the strap of her gas mask. Her eyes had a marked epicanthic fold, like she was Chinese, which Kira couldn’t puzzle out—the Chinese were the enemy in the Isolation War. Why make a Partial the other soldiers might mistake for an enemy? She held a menacing rifle trained on Samm’s back, the muzzle tipped with the fat black cylinder of a suppressor. Kira recognized it as a sniper rifle.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The girl stopped just a few yards away, maybe two good strides if Kira sprinted—probably not enough time for the girl to react. Kira nodded, gearing herself up for the attack. She’d learned a little hand-to-hand in school, though not much; the Defense Grid figured if a Partial got that close you were screwed anyway, since they were so much stronger. Kira hoped it wasn’t true, and rose to the balls of her feet.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Don’t say anything,” said Samm. His voice was strained, like he was speaking through teeth clenched as tight as he could make them. “Don’t speak.” He put his hand to his face, covering his mouth and nose. Kira stood, placing her feet carefully, coiling her muscles for a charging tackle.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span><i>Small of the back</i>, she told herself. <i>Hit low and hard. Pin her arms. Strike at the base of the skull to knock her—</i></span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Samm,” said the girl, and Kira froze.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span><i>She knows his name? Is that part of the link?</i></span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span><i>Or is she part of his company?</i></span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Don’t speak,” Samm growled, but already Kira’s thoughts were flying, connections snapping together in her mind. If this girl knew Samm, that meant they were part of the same faction, which meant the nearby soldiers were Samm’s own comrades. Samm’s own officers. He’d said the link was also used to enforce the chain of command: They could sense Samm was here, and they were ordering him to respond. That’s why he was moving so stiffly—it was taking every ounce of his strength to resist them.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span><i>But why is he hiding from his own people?</i></span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Talk to me, Samm.” The woman stepped forward, keeping the rifle aimed squarely at his back. “We thought you’d been captured.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Samm lowered his head, nearly collapsing into the dirt. <i>He won’t hold on much longer</i>, Kira thought. <i>Go!</i> She pelted forward, arms spread wide, shoulder down to nail the Partial in the small of the back.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>And then the Partial whirled around.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira was already inside the range where the long rifle would be useless as a gun. Instead the Partial brought it down like a club, slamming the heavy stock into the side of Kira’s face just as Kira wrapped her arms around the girl’s waist and knocked her solidly to the ground. Both girls gasped in pain at the impact, but Kira’s head was still ringing from the rifle blow, and the other girl recovered first. She dropped her gun and grappled Kira with cold efficiency, twisting one arm behind her back and kneeing her painfully in the stomach. Kira fought wildly, clawing at the Partial’s face and neck and very nearly escaping from her grip, twisting just enough to keep it from becoming a true submission hold. Suddenly Kira felt the cold metal edge of a knife on her throat, and the girl spoke calmly in her ear.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Stop moving now.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira froze; there was nothing she could do. If she’d had just two more seconds to work with, maybe, but somehow the Partial had known that Kira was there.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Let go of her, Heron, she’s with me.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“She doesn’t link.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“She’s human.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Heron’s voice was surprised, but she didn’t loosen her grip. “You captured one? The mission was a success? Where’s the rest of your team?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span><i>You captured one</i>? thought Kira. She loosened the girl’s grip on her throat and shouted loudly at both of them. “What the hell is going on?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“They’re dead,” said Samm, stepping closer to Heron, “but it’s not what you think. You can let her go—she’s not a threat. She’s on our side.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira couldn’t believe what she was hearing. “Were you planning this all along?” she asked. “Was this whole thing just a trick to get me back here?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“It’s more complicated than that,” said Samm quickly. He was in front of her now, the mask ripped off. “Kuso, Heron, let her go, she came willingly!”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“So there was no peace proposal?” Kira demanded. She felt herself grow hot, felt her eyes begin to tear, felt a rush of shame and anger that she had ever trusted this thing. “No truce?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Heron smiled. “A truce? I’m impressed, Samm; you may have a future in espionage.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira saw a flash in the corner of her eye, the glint of light on a hypodermic needle. She screamed and felt it prick into her neck. The effect was almost instant: Her eyes grew heavy, her mind seemed to warp and bend. The world grew dark and thick, and Kira had time for one last thought before she fell unconscious.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span><i>I’m going to die</i>.</span></p>
