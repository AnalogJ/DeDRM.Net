<p class="Firstpara"><span><span class="dropcap">“I</span>t doesn’t make sense,” said Xochi. “My mother hates Partials—she would have killed that thing with her bare hands if they’d let her get close to it. Why do they want it alive?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Keep it down,” said Kira. She glanced out the window again, peering through a small gap in the shades. “If anyone hears you—if anyone even finds out that we told you—there’s going to be some serious hell to pay.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Mkele probably wants to try to interrogate it,” said Jayden. He and Haru started their sentences in hard labor the next morning, but the Senate had given them the night to gather their things. Haru was at home with Madison, but Jayden had come to Nandita’s place. Nandita was gone, off on another herb-collecting trip; Kira shuddered to think of the explaining she’d have to do when Nandita got back. She could take insults from people she hated, but it was the disappointment from someone she loved that always broke her down. She started tearing up just thinking about it and forced herself to think of something else.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I think you may be forgetting a key fact here,” said Isolde. “Apparently Partials are smoking hot. If you’d have told me that before you left, I would have gone to Manhattan with you.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Come on, Isolde, that’s gross.” Kira grimaced.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“You saw it, same as I did,” said Isolde. “That thing is an Adonis. Do something for me: When you get to spend your five days alone with that genetic perfection, try to find time for a close physical examination. Just for me.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“It’s not even human,” said Jayden.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“In what sense?” asked Isolde, continuing to bait him. “It’s got all the right parts in all the right places. If this is what Para-Gen was going for when they started making artificial people, now I’m even sadder that it went nuts and tried to kill us.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“The questions in this hearing were nothing,” said Jayden, finally deciding to ignore her. “All slow-pitch softball. Tonight they’re going to put it in a subbasement somewhere, torture it, and learn everything they can. A night with some Grid soldiers in a soundproof room will take the fight right out of it.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Now you’re really turning me on,” said Isolde.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Shut up,” said Jayden, and Xochi laughed.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“But why do they want me in charge?” asked Kira. “There are researchers with more experience than me, there are more skilled lab techs, there are—”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I know,” said Xochi. “Anybody in that hospital would be better for this than you. No offense.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“None taken,” said Kira. “That’s what I’ve been saying all night.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Right,” said Xochi. “So think about it: Why put your most junior student in charge of something that important unless you want to guarantee that it’ll go wrong? Or to use her as a scapegoat when the whole thing blows up in their faces?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I’m sure there’s a better reason than that,” Kira said, though at heart she wasn’t sure at all. She looked out the window again, scanning the dark street. Nothing.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I don’t think he’s coming,” said Xochi.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira turned back quickly. “What? No, I was just … looking at the trees. At the open street that isn’t teeming with panthers and poison ivy.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“The world across the line was pretty different,” said Jayden, nodding. “I don’t know how to describe it.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“It’s because there weren’t any people,” said Isolde. “Manhattan’s gone more primal than Long Island because there’s never anyone scaring away the animals or stomping down the plants.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Jayden laughed thinly. “There are forty thousand people on Long Island,” he said. “There used to be millions. Sometimes I think this island doesn’t even know we’re here.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“It’s not just Manhattan,” said Kira, “it’s everywhere—we saw a panther in Brooklyn. We saw a baby antelope—a little antelope fawn, probably two months old at the most. Someday they’ll wonder where all those weird, two-legged animals went, and then they’ll take a drink from a river, and look up at the clouds, and then they’ll forget they were ever even thinking about us at all. Life will go on. There’s no point even leaving a record behind, because there will never be anyone, ever again, who can read it.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Somebody’s depressed,” said Jayden.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Xochi punched him in the arm. “Does anyone want some more home fries?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Ooh, me,” said Isolde, sitting up. “Forget extinction—I’m dying the day all our vegetable oil finally runs out.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Xochi passed her the plate and stood up. “I’m sick of ‘Antonio, on His Bar Mitzvah.’ Any requests?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Phineas,” said Kira. “No—Nissyen. He always cheers me up.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Xochi sorted through her basket of players, glancing quickly at the generator to make sure there was power. Isolde took a bite of potato and pointed at Kira with the other half, talking with her mouth full.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I think you’re just spooked,” she said. “All joking aside, that thing almost killed you in the field, and now you have to work with it.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Not with it.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“With it in the room,” said Isolde. “You know what I mean. I think it’s scary.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I think you’re scary,” said Xochi. She plugged in a music player—<small>TO NISSYEN FROM LISA</small>—and bubbly techno started playing in the background. “You’re the most elegant one of us,” Xochi continued, sitting next to Isolde, “and here you are flinging fried potatoes around like you’re an outlands street vendor.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I may be a little drunk,” said Isolde seriously, pointing at Xochi with her half-chewed fry. She raised her eyebrow. “Senator Hobb gave me some champagne.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Ooh la la,” said Xochi.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Maybe beacuse the hearing went better than expected?” said Isolde. She shrugged. “I wasn’t going to say no.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“But they didn’t get anything they wanted,” said Kira, sitting up straighter. “Four dumb kids forced them into…” She stopped. “Unless that’s what they wanted all along.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“They wanted it alive?” asked Jayden. “They wanted you to study it?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I don’t know,” said Kira. “None of it makes sense.” She looked out the window. Still nothing.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Doesn’t it make you a little suspicious, though?” asked Xochi. “If the Senate is running some kind of weird scheme here, how many other things are they doing that we don’t know about?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“You’re being paranoid,” said Jayden. “What kind of horrible conspiracies do you think they’ve got going?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“They’re hiding a Partial inside the city limits,” said Xochi. “If they’re capable of that, why not more?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The room went quiet.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Attacks against the farms,” said Xochi. “Accused Voices disappearing in the middle of the night. We accept these things because we think we know the reasons behind them, but what if we don’t? What if the reasons we’ve been told all along are just lies?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I’ve been Senator Hobb’s assistant for nearly a year,” said Isolde, “and I can guarantee you I’m not keeping any dangerous state secrets.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“You’re defending the honesty of a group that you know, firsthand, is lying to the people of East Meadow,” said Xochi. “And they’re doing it too effectively to be first-timers. The only surprising thing about it is that any of you are surprised.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I think Xochi’s right,” said Kira. She felt a pit in her stomach, slowly growing deeper and darker as she thought through Xochi’s logic.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Why are you so desperate to attack them?” asked Jayden. “Listen, Xochi, I’m sorry your mom is a bitch, but she’s not the entire Senate. And what about the Defense Grid? You’re talking about people who defend us and keep us safe—people who die in the outlands so that you can sit here with your monogrammed music players and your fancy foods and whine about how oppressed you are.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Not counting your own fiasco,” said Xochi hotly, “when’s the last time a soldier actually died in combat?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Last year, in the Voice raid on the Hampton farms.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“And how do you know that was the Voice?” Xochi demanded.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Why would they lie to us?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“How do you know there wasn’t just some disgruntled farmer,” Xochi pressed, “who refused to send in his quota, so the Long Island Bloody Defense Grid went out to rough him up a little?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Why would they lie to us?” Jayden repeated.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Because it keeps us in line!” Xochi shouted back. “Look at everything we go through—armed soldiers in the streets, invasive searches of everyone going in and out of the market; they’ve even started searching homes. The Senate says jump and we ask how high because they’ve convinced us the Voice will kill us if we don’t. Our boys go to war, our girls get pregnant, and we always do everything they say and it never changes anything. Nothing ever gets better. You know why? Because if it gets better, we don’t have to listen to them anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira flicked her eyes from person to person, shocked by the outburst. Everyone else seemed as shocked as she was.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Jayden grumbled and stood up. “You’re insane,” he said, walking to the door. “I’ve got better things to do with my time than waste it here.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Idiot,” Xochi muttered, and stormed into the kitchen.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira looked at Isolde, who looked back with wide, startled eyes.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“They’re not evil,” said Isolde. “I work with them every day—they’re just people. Hobb’s really trying to do his best.” She paused. “You should take your own gun tomorrow. We have no idea how strong the Partials are, or what they’re capable of. Do you have a handgun?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira shook her head. “I’m a rifle girl, but that’s mostly just at home. It wouldn’t be very useful inside the lab.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I’ll give you mine,” said Isolde. “Town hall is swarming with soldiers, and you just became zookeeper to a hyperintelligent predator. You need it more than I do.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira looked out the window at the empty street. “I guess we may as well go get it,” she said softly. “The party’s dead anyway.” She walked out with Isolde, paused on the porch, and waited a few long seconds before stepping down and leaving.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Marcus never came.</span></p>
<p class="normalSb"><span>Dr. Skousen led Kira down a long hall. “This used to be a quarantine room,” he said, pointing toward the heavy steel door at the end of the corridor. “We haven’t used it for that, or for anything else, really, in years. The custodians spent all night cleaning it out. I’m afraid that the seals aren’t all as tight as we’d like them to be, but we’ve got the salvage crews working overtime looking for new medical supply stores and new hospitals and clinics—anywhere that might have the right kind of plastic for the doors and windows. We’ll be safe enough for now.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span><i>And I’ll be locked inside with a Partial</i>, thought Kira. She clutched her stack of vials and notebooks and other equipment, trying not to drop them as she matched Skousen’s brisk pace.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>He lowered his voice, whispering covertly as they turned the final corner. “We’ve spent the night searching it for anything that could be a weapon, cleaning it, weighing it—anything that required it to be unrestrained. Now it’s strapped down, and it’s all yours.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>They reached the door, a seven-foot steel barrier flanked by two soldiers in helmets and body armor. One of them was Shaylon Brown, the private she’d met on the Asharoken salvage run, and he smiled as he turned to unlock the door. Kira looked at Skousen, keeping a tight grip on her precarious load of equipment.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Anything else I need to know?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Learn everything you can,” he said gravely. “I didn’t want you to do this, and I still think it was idiotic to attempt, but now that we have one … this is a rare opportunity, and I honestly don’t know how long the other senators are going to allow it, five-day promise or not. Make sure you report everything directly to me, especially if you find something … ominous. The last thing we want is a panic.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Got it,” said Kira. “Well then.” She turned to the door, took a deep breath, and walked past the soldiers. “Thanks for keeping me safe, guys.” <i>If you need me, I’ll be locked inside here with the monster</i>.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The entryway was a short tube of clear, flexible plastic, with a soft electric hum from a grate on the floor—an electromagnetic grid designed to pull foreign particles from her shoes. <i>There’s supposed to be a—</i> She looked around for the air jets just in time to get blasted in the face by an artificial whirlwind, sweeping her clean and pulling dust and hair and other contaminants down to the same electric grid. She managed to keep her grip on her vials and papers, and when the air stopped, she pushed forward into the room itself.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The Partial lay on an operating table in the center of the room; it was strapped down tightly with thick leather restraints, and the table was bolted to the floor. It was awake, its eyes alert, watching her as she stepped into the converted room. The walls were lined with counters and medicomps and other equipment, all clean and well-lit. She had Isolde’s semiautomatic on her hip.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She’d never been more terrified in her life.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira stood for a moment, saying nothing, then crossed to the wall and set her things on a counter. The sample vials rolled free and she paused to gather them up, placing them one by one in a plastic rack. She swallowed, staring at the rack, willing herself to turn and face the Partial. It was nothing—it was one man, not even a man but a teenager, all alone and tied up. She’d faced it and others like it under far worse conditions only a few days before. And yet things felt different here; everything seemed off and out of place. A Partial in the wilds was an enemy, and she knew how to think about it, but a Partial here, in East Meadow, in the same room…</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She saw a glint of light in the corner of her eye, and turned to see the lens of a small camera mounted in the corner. It was obviously new and out of place, mounted blockily on the wood of the counter with thick screws. She turned to scan the room and saw five more: one in each corner, and two higher up to get specific angles on both the Partial’s table and her own workstation. Mkele’s work, she assumed, and she felt some of her nervousness lift at the thought that he and his soldiers were watching her so closely. If the Partial tried anything, they’d see it and respond.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira let out a breath she didn’t realize she was holding. She couldn’t decide if knowing Mkele was watching made her feel more safe, or less. She walked past the bound Partial to the window.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She was on the second floor, looking out through a strip of tall trees to a wide parking lot full of sagging cars. Many of the parking lots in town were empty—not much business at the local restaurants while civilization was collapsing around you—but the hospital had been packed and overflowing eleven years ago, and their cars remained like ghostly reminders.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span><i>I need to take a blood sample</i>, Kira told herself, forcing herself back to the task at hand. <i>I need blood and tissue. I went all the way to a war zone to cut the hand off an enemy soldier, I can take a biopsy from the thing lying tied up fifteen feet away</i>.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She walked back to the sample vials she’d brought with her—blood samples she’d taken from Marcus. Relics of her first attempt at studying RM, before Manhattan and the Partial and everything else. Before Marcus didn’t come. She still had all the notes she’d taken from the blood, full descriptions of platelet counts and white cell counts and glucose and electrolytes and calcium levels and the vast, terrifying mass of viral structures. Every human being was a carrier, poisoning their own children long after the Partials had disappeared. Were the Partials carriers as well? Was this whole catastrophe useless?</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She breathed deeply, wiped her face, and turned to look at the Partial—not a faceless thing in a black visor but a man, a boy barely older than she was, tied to a table and stripped almost to nothing. With his shirt off, she could see his body was toned and muscular, not bulging like a bodybuilder but simply fit: strong and lean and capable. Genetic perfection, as Isolde had put it. Kira tried to summon her zeal from the fight in Manhattan, tried to imagine herself cutting off its hand for study. It had brown eyes, like hers. It looked back calmly.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Dr. Skousen had said that they’d washed the Partial, but Kira looked again and saw there were flecks of something around its face and head. She stepped closer, trying to get a better look, then closer again, peering at its face. It was flecks of blood, dried and black, ringing its mouth and eye and dotting its ear on the other side. She reached out to brush away its hair, paused with her hand halfway, and dropped it back to her side.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I take it they beat you?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The Partial said nothing, simply watching her through dark eyes. She could feel its anger like the heat from an iron stove, radiating out in waves. She steeled herself and reached out again, and this time the Partial turned on her suddenly, jerking its head and straining at its bonds. Kira jumped back involuntarily, her heart racing, and reached for her gun. She didn’t pull it out, merely felt it, solid and reassuring in her hand. She forced herself to calm down and stepped forward again, standing straight. After a moment she pulled out the gun anyway and held it up for the Partial to see.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I was part of the group that captured you,” she said. “I’m not trying to threaten you, I’m just telling you how serious I am. We’ve got five days together, and if you want to spend them fighting, I am more than ready.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>It watched her, eyes cold and hard, as if studying her for any break it could use, any hole in her defenses it could slip through—</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>—and yet behind the cold eyes it was terrified. She could tell, just by looking at it, that it had never been this scared in its life. She took a step back, looking at the situation from its perspective: It was alone, a prisoner of war, beaten and chained and strapped down to an operating table, and now she was holding a gun on it.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira looked down at the gun in her hand and put it away. “In case you couldn’t tell, everyone here is pretty much terrified of you. We don’t know what you can do or how you work. For all we know, you’re a biological weapon with legs.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She paused, waiting, but he stayed silent. She prompted him with her hand, but still nothing. She sighed. She wasn’t sure what she was waiting for from him.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>He watched her closely, and she felt uncomfortably like a bug in a jar. Who was really studying who?</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Fine, then,” she said. “If you don’t want to talk, that’s fine. I don’t think I would in your situation either, frankly, but then again I don’t know if I could help myself. Humans are very social creatures; we like to communicate in order to feel—”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“You talk too much.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira stopped, eyes wide. His voice was dry and hoarse from days of disuse—as far as she knew, it hadn’t said a word since they’d captured it, now more than fifty hours ago. She almost wasn’t sure she’d heard him right. <i>The first human to communicate with another species in eleven years</i>, she thought, <i>and he tells me to shut up</i>. When the initial shock wore off, she almost started laughing.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Point taken,” she said, nodding. “But first let me explain what I’m going to do. Most of our tests here are going to be sensor-based, noninvasive stuff, looking at your organs, that sort of…” It closed its eyes, pointedly ignoring her, and she trailed off. “All right then, no medical explanations.” Kira walked to a side counter, rooted through the drawers, and came back with a sterilized glass tube and a handful of little instruments. “Let me at least warn you, though, this finger poker is going to hurt a bit—it’s nothing horrible, just a spring-loaded pin about two millimeters long. Are you going to let me use your finger, or are we going to fight again?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>He opened his eyes, saw the finger poker, and looked up at Kira’s face. After a long moment, he unrolled his fist and laid out his fingers.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Thank you.” She shook a few drops of ethanol onto a ball of cotton and swabbed his index finger. His hands were firm and warm. The poker was about the size and shape of a dental floss container, and she pressed it against his fingertip. “Brace yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>He barely flinched. The pin jabbed into its fingertip, and she pulled it away quickly, pressing a skinny glass tube against the wound. It slowly filled with blood, more slowly than usual, and she squeezed its finger, pressing out more. The flow stopped before she could even fill the tube.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Your blood pressure might be low,” she commented, sealing up the tube with a frown. “Usually I can fill two vials on one finger. Unless…” She peered in closer, watching the blood in the tube as it started to congeal. She looked at its finger, prodding the hole gently. It had already sealed itself closed. “That’s amazing,” she whispered. She held the glass tube up to her eye; the blood was turning a rusty brown, firming up until it was capped on both ends by a small, solid scab.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She looked back at the Partial. It said nothing.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira’s first impulse was to poke it again, deeper this time, but she recoiled from the idea almost as quickly as she had it. She wasn’t here to torture it, and fast healing or not, it could still feel pain. Its flinch at the finger poker had been proof enough of that. She didn’t have the stomach to wound it just to watch how it reacted.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>And yet … wasn’t that what the Senate wanted? Wasn’t that what she was here to do? She wouldn’t just go cutting him with knives, but they had told her to study him, and if the Partial resistance to RM was based on a powerful self-regenerative system, then she would have to test the limits of his healing power and determine how, if at all, they could use it for themselves. If she couldn’t find the answer elsewhere, she would have to look there.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Could it take a gunshot? What would happen to the bullet? Her gut warred with her scientific curiosity. She shook her head and set down the scabbed-over tube.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I’m not going to torture you,” she said, going back to the drawers and retrieving a small plastic syringe and a short, sharp needle. “But I do have to get another blood sample. The medicomp needs liquid blood to give me a good picture of what’s going on in there, so if you scab over on instant contact with air, we’ll have to keep air out of the equation for as long as possible.” She fitted the syringe with the needle, found a tube of saline solution, and drew it in and out of the needle until she was fairly certain all the internal space had been filled with liquid. She swabbed the vein on the Partial’s inner elbow and held the needle above it. “Get ready for another poke.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>This time it didn’t flinch at all. She drew a cubic centimeter of blood and started to tape a cotton ball to the hole in its arm, but quickly realized that it was, of course, already healing over. She felt a little foolish and turned away, putting the entire syringe, needle and all, into the medicomp. The blood was still liquid. She stripped off her gloves and started tapping the screen, calling up blood tests and liver screens and everything else she could think of, triggering the “comprehensive scan” message that had identified the virus last time. With Marcus. She tapped yes and waited, practically holding her breath, while the medicomp catalogued the blood.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She hadn’t allowed herself to think about Marcus yet; she hadn’t ever really had time. Less than twenty-four hours ago she was still in the back of a Defense Grid truck, pulling into East Meadow for her secret hearing with the Senate. Marcus hadn’t come to Xochi’s last night—and she hadn’t gone to look for him—and then in the morning she’d come straight here. Was he still mad at her? Was she even still mad at him? Yes, she was—of course she was—but at the same time she could see his side. She knew now that he had been … what? Trying to protect her? She didn’t need to be protected, not when she was the only one trying to do something here. But was he right about RM—that it couldn’t be cured, and they were ruining their lives by trying? She couldn’t believe that, couldn’t even allow herself to think it. She was going to cure the damned thing, and that was all there was to it. But then what did she think she understood about Marcus?</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>That he was scared, and thought he was going to lose her. She could understand that. She’d been half convinced she was going to die herself.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The medicomp chirped, and Kira looked back at the screen. It had higher-than-average electrolytes in its blood, a glucose level that looked borderline diabetic, and a white cell count so high she couldn’t help but take its temperature, fearing an infection. It was 98.6 degrees exactly, just as she was. Maybe its physiology had a slightly different baseline of normal? The results that would indicate illness in a normal human patient, but as far as she knew, they were normal for a Partial. She copied the details down in her notebook, marking the anomalies she wanted to go back and study later.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>But the most important part of the scan was what was missing after she’d gone through it all. It had no trace of RM whatsoever.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>No RM. She looked up, ecstatic; the Partial was still lying on the table, staring silently at the ceiling, and somehow still managing to look dangerous. Anyone else in that position would look like they’d given up, but there was something about it—the tension in its muscles, the alert flicker of its eyes—that told Kira its mind was racing.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>In that moment it didn’t matter. Kira felt like laughing—the Partial had no trace of RM in its blood, just like she’d predicted. Its body could destroy or expel the virus completely. All she had to do was figure out how.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She tapped the screen quickly, fingers dancing across the surface as she pulled up the files on the virus. Now that she knew the Partials didn’t carry it, she had to figure out how, exactly, the humans did—what was the infection process? It wasn’t enough to just say, “They got sick”; she needed to know how the virus traveled from person to person, and what happened when it got there, in precise microbial detail. She needed to watch the process in a human and in a Partial, to see how they differed. She pulled up the image of the virus again, the yellow-tinged blob that lived in the blood. <i>You look like a balloon</i>, she thought, <i>but you killed 99.996 percent of the human race</i>.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She needed to focus. What information did the file already have? Size, for one thing: four hundred nanometers. That was huge for this scale—definitely big enough to be stopped by a good air filter. She glanced across the room to the plastic tunnel by the door, wondering what kind of filter it used. <i>A system like that should be able to stop a four-hundred-nanometer virus</i>, she thought. <i>Four hundred nanometers should keep it away from a fetus, as well; nothing that big should be able to cross the placental barrier. That could explain why the babies don’t get sick until after they’re born</i>.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira paused, caught by a sudden thought. <i>If the virus is big enough to be contained, why can’t we deliver infants in a contained environment?</i> They scrubbed the room, they sterilized their tools, they wore gas masks—they did everything they could think of, yet the virus still got through.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span><i>I’m not the first person to ask that question</i>, she thought. <i>Marcus and Dr. Skousen both said that people have been researching this since the Break. That means there’ll be records somewhere of their findings</i>. She called up the database files in the microscope, searching for studies of all their clean-room births, and found several. None had been successful, obviously; the rate of sickness and the onset of RM was virtually identical to that of normal births, as if the clean room had shown no effect at all. Attached to the records was another set of studies, this time focusing on the existence of an RM variant found only in the air. Kira opened this with interest—she knew that RM was airborne, of course, but the actual structure of the airborne virus was not exactly entry-level medicine, and they hadn’t talked about it yet in any of her classes. The report contained more images, similar to those in her blood sample but much smaller: between twenty-three and thirty-one nanometers. Kira frowned. Something that small would be almost impossible to catch, even with a clean room. She looked at the Partial, feeling a surge of her old anger.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“You made pretty damn sure we couldn’t get away from this thing, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The Partial turned its head to look at her, and Kira felt like she could almost see the thoughts whirring through its mind. When it spoke, its eyes seemed almost … curious. “You can’t reproduce.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“What?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“That’s why you’re trying to cure RM. We don’t have children, so their absence didn’t seem odd at first, but you don’t have any, do you? You’re trying to cure RM because your children don’t survive it.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira wanted to scream at it, to force it to acknowledge its own hand in their extinction, to attack it for daring to speak so matter-of-factly about something so terrible, and yet she stopped, one thought catching in her mind.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Did it not know the virus was still killing them? She knew she shouldn’t trust it, but it seemed like something it was just now understanding. It really hadn’t known. But if it hadn’t known, that suggested two very important things: first, that the Partials weren’t spying on them. The theories cropped up now and then, that Partials were hiding among them, infiltrating the island with deep cover spies. But if that were true, this one would already have known that human infants were dying. Its surprise meant they weren’t being watched.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span><i>Or if they are watching</i>, she thought, <i>they aren’t telling each other what they see</i>.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The second thing it suggested was that the Partials—or at least this Partial in particular—did not know how RM worked. It hadn’t expected the virus to stick around, and presumably most of the Partials it interacted with thought the same. Were the Partial leaders hiding the information from their own soldiers, or did they not know either? And how could they not know the function of a virus they’d created? It was possible the virus had mutated; Kira shuddered at the thought of it. If something as deadly as RM was mutating, acting beyond its original parameters, who knew what it was capable of?</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She supposed there was one way to find out how much he knew. “You,” she said, “Partial. What do you know about RM?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>It didn’t answer.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Oh, come on,” said Kira, rolling her head back in frustration. “Are we going to go through this again? Can’t you at least say something?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Well, human,” he said, “you’re going to kill me in five days. I don’t see much of an incentive to say anything.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira stormed back to the medicomp and threw herself into the chair, so angry she could hardly think. It was going to be killed because it had killed Gabe, and Skinny, and six billion other people. After everything it had done, every atrocity it had been a part of, how dare it have the temerity to imply that it was a victim?</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The images on the screen seemed to swirl and blur; how could she concentrate with that thing lying twenty feet away? It was times like this when she needed Marcus to make a joke, to defuse the situation and help her realize what mattered and what didn’t. She looked at the door, but of course he wasn’t there. He didn’t even know where she was.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The Partial was right about one thing: She only had five days. She needed to work. She pushed the Partials out of her mind and forced herself to focus on the task at hand: a screen full of viral images, a series of reports on the viral structure. It had two forms, one for blood and one for air; the Blob and the Spore, the yellow and the blue. <i>Concentrate!</i> The Spore was tiny, perfect for traveling through the air. That must be how the virus passed from host to host. But then what was the Blob for?</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>None of the studies had the answer; they knew both forms of the virus existed, but not how they worked together. Kira turned back to the sample report from Marcus’s blood, combing through the results for any sign of the Spore. If it <i>could</i> get into the body, it <i>would</i>; there should be some sign of it in Marcus’s sample, but there was nothing. That meant that whatever happened to the Spore when it got into the body was happening very quickly, and leaving no trace.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>That is, the Blob <i>was</i> the trace. Kira ran through the possibilities in her head: The virus obviously reacted to human blood and tissue—that was how it worked, using the host body’s own material to replicate itself—so maybe there was an extra layer of interaction. Maybe the Spore wasn’t designed to replicate itself at all, just to convert itself into the Blob and let that one replicate. It was weird, but it was possible. <i>Whatever it does</i>, thought Kira, <i>it has to do it quickly: By the time we get a chance to test the blood, any samples of the Spore have all been converted</i>. Kira ran her fingers through her hair, trying to figure out how to see the transformation in action. If she could get a sample of uninfected blood, and get it into the medicomp fast enough, she’d be able to study the actual process of infection. But where could she find uninfected human blood?</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>In the newborns. There were four pregnant women in the city due to deliver in the next week, and several samples beyond that if one of the other mothers delivered early.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She would put a request in to Dr. Skousen, just to see what he said. They always took blood samples at birth, but they usually didn’t test those samples for several minutes while they dealt with other problems—most blood samples aren’t this time-sensitive. If Kira’s theory was correct, they’d have to test the blood immediately if they wanted to see this specific reaction.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The next question was the more difficult one: If the Blob came from transformed Spores, where did the Spores come from? Did the Blob create them, or did it transform back? Observing that change would be difficult, because she had no idea how it worked, and thus how to re-create it. Obviously the transformation couldn’t happen in the blood, because it would reverse itself instantly. The lack of any Spore samples in Marcus’s blood attested to that. <i>In the lungs, then? Does the Blob react to oxygen the same way the Spore reacts to tissue?</i> It was the simplest answer, which made it the best place to start. But how could she test it?</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span><i>I need to isolate the virus first</i>, she thought. She looked around the room for something that could trap the tiny virus, and her eyes fell on a box of latex gloves. She remembered how she and Marcus used to inflate them in school, pinching them almost closed and blowing them full of air. If the virus transformation really did happen in the lungs, her breath would be full of it. <i>And if a rubber glove will hold oxygen, it’ll contain the virus too, at least long enough to take a look at in the medicomp</i>. She walked to the rubber gloves, held one to her mouth, and blew it up like a balloon. <i>Now what?</i> She stood in the middle of the room uncertainly. Would the medicomp be able to read anything through the rubber? Probably, even if she felt stupid shoving an inflated rubber glove into the sensor bay. But there was another problem, which was that whatever she did with her own breath, she’d have to do the same with the Partial’s breath as well. Both tests needed to be the same, or the results wouldn’t mean anything, and she was pretty sure the Partial wouldn’t blow up a rubber glove. She let the glove deflate. She’d have to think of something else.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We were winning the war,” said the Partial softly. Kira still started when it spoke, not expecting to hear anything from it.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“What?” Kira stared at it, then shoved the glove into her pocket. “Why the hell are you bringing that up?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Because you think we created the virus; that’s why you’re studying me as part of your mission to cure it. You think we engineered it.” It shook its head. “We didn’t.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Obviously I expect you to lie to me,” said Kira, “but I was hoping you’d be a little more creative.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“It’s the truth.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“It is not true!” she shouted. The Partial didn’t respond, simply watched her from the table. Its eyes were dark and serious. “You attacked us, you killed us, and you released that virus to finish the job.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We were winning the war,” it said again. “We were the largest branch of your military, so there was no effective way for you to fight back; we struck quickly, we took out your communications, we crippled your counterattack. You had no way of stopping us. In another few weeks, maybe as few as two, we would have taken full control of the government, and we would have done it without losing the infrastructure your society had created—electricity, natural gas, shipping and industry and food production—”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Was that your plan?” asked Kira bitterly. “To use us as slaves? As labor to maintain your infrastructure?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“You mean the same thing you had done to us?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira stared at it, anger rising up by the second, hot as a welding torch burning through her from inside. She pulled the glove back out of her pocket, stalked to the medicomp, and threw the glove into the hazmat can.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We didn’t want to enslave you,” said the Partial. “Even if we did, we didn’t want or need to kill you to do it. There was no purpose, tactical or political or otherwise, in releasing a killer virus.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“You expect me to believe that a perfect supervirus, which destroyed humans and left you unscathed, was coincidentally released in the middle of your attack—and that you had nothing at all to do with it?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I admit that it seems far-fetched.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Far-fetched is an understatement.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We’ve been searching for an explanation ever since,” it said, “but we still don’t know where it came from.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I don’t know why I am even talking to you,” said Kira. It was crazy to think she was putting any credence in anything it said—and she was crazy to be listening to it at all. She turned back to the medicomp, staring angrily at the images and data, but she couldn’t stop herself from glancing at the Partial, first once, then again. It knew something. If she could see through its lies, perhaps there was something useful in what it was saying. Everything it said was flat and emotionless, almost as if it didn’t, or couldn’t, care. She swiveled fully toward it, leaning forward in her chair. “All right,” she said, “since you’re in such a talkative mood: Why were you in Manhattan?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>It said nothing. She waited, staring at him, and asked again in frustration, “What was your mission? Why were you so close to our border?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I can’t tell you.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Why not?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The Partial stared at the ceiling. “Because I don’t want them to kill me.”</span></p>
