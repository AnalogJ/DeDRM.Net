<p class="Firstpara"><span><span class="dropcap">I</span>t was nearly midnight when Kira left the hospital, and she shivered slightly in the cool air—summer or not, night on Long Island could still get chilly. The Partial had refused to say any more, and Kira was half grateful: As desperate as she was to know what he was talking about, she was also scared. If what it knew was so dangerous that even talking about it would get it killed … she shivered again, just thinking about it.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Instead, she’d spent the day buried in the medicomp files, studying the virus: its specific structure, the proteins that made up the walls and receptor nodes, the genetic payload it carried inside. The hospital had some incredibly advanced genetic equipment, some of the same old devices they had once used for genetic modification—everything from curing diseases to changing eye color—but all the people who knew how to use them had died in the Break. It was ironic, in a way, that they had such incredible technology, from a time so recent, that no living person could understand. Sometimes Kira almost thought of them as magic: mystic artifacts from some forgotten civilization. Dr. Skousen and his researchers studied them in darkened rooms, surrounded by the ancient tomes of their craft, but the magic was gone. They could find the genetic coding in RM, but they couldn’t change it or even read it. All they could do was watch, and guess, and hope for a breakthrough.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira had found no breakthroughs. There were four days left.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She walked slowly through the city, eager to go home and collapse into sleep but still aimless, in a way, as if her brain were too tired of focusing, and wanted simply to meander. She followed it through the darkened city, passing quiet houses and cracked sidewalks and dirty roads beaten smooth by traffic. At night East Meadow seemed almost as empty as the outside world—the omnipresent plant growth was kept in check by the sheer mass of people and animals, but the houses were just as dark, the streets just as empty, the world just as quiet. In the daytime the city was populated but sparse; in the night, it was just another part of the ruin that covered the world.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira rounded a corner and realized where she was—where she’d been walking, subconsciously, since the moment she left the hospital. Marcus’s street. She stood on the corner, unmoving, counting down the houses <i>five, four, three, two, one</i> and then his on the right. He’d lived with an older man for several years, then moved in with another foster parent when the first man died, and when he turned sixteen he moved out into his own place. It was no big deal, moving; all you had to do was find a house in good condition, clean it up, and there you were. The owners were all dead, the banks were all defunct, there were more than enough for everyone to have two, five, even ten houses if you wanted them. Long Island had been home to millions of people. The old world had been consumed with the search for More Stuff. Now there was more stuff than anyone could ever use, and little or none of anything else.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira saw a gleam of yellow light, faint and distant. She paused, squinting, and saw it again. It was definitely Marcus’s house. Why was he up this late? She walked forward, stepping carefully over the tree-root cracks in the buckled sidewalk, keeping her eyes on the flickering light. It was a candle, shining softly through the window. She stopped on the lawn in front, peering in at the room beyond: a candle, a chair, and Marcus, asleep sitting up. The walls were bare, marked with the nails of somebody else’s photos, now pulled down or stored or thrown away. She watched Marcus for an endless moment, and then suddenly he was watching her, his head raised, his eyes open.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>He sat still, watching with wide eyes, waiting for her to move. She stood still and watched back.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The candle flickered.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Marcus stood up and disappeared behind the frame of the window, and then the front door opened. Kira was running up the porch steps before she even knew what was happening, and when Marcus appeared in the doorway, she threw her arms around him, sinking her face into his chest. He caught her tightly, holding her close, and she closed her eyes and soaked him in: his strength, his smell, his presence, as recognizable to her as her own. He’d been a part of her life for as long as she could remember; he was more real than anything in the old world. That was the life she’d been born in, but this—East Meadow, Marcus, even RM—was the life she lived. She held him close, raising her face and finding his. Their lips met in a long, fierce, desperate kiss.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I’m sorry I didn’t go with you,” Marcus whispered. “I regretted it every day you were gone.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“You could have died,” said Kira, shaking her head and then kissing him again.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“But I should have been with you,” he said, his voice hard. “I should have been there to protect you. I love you, Kira.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I love you too,” she said softly, but a voice in the back of her head said, <i>You didn’t need to be protected</i>.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She ignored the voice, shoving it away. Right now, all she wanted in the entire world was to be in his arms.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“You got one, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira paused, not wanting to talk or even think about the Partial, then nodded. “Yeah.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“The rumors are going around. Everybody knows the Grid brought something back from the west end of the island, but nobody knows what. It wasn’t hard for me to put two and two together.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira felt a wave of tension creep back through her body, remembering how tense the city had been before she’d left it. How close the people were to civil war. “You think anyone else has figured it out?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I doubt it,” said Marcus. “Bringing a Partial into the middle of East Meadow is not exactly the first thing that’s going to leap into anyone’s mind.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Maybe not the first,” said Kira, “but the second, or the fifth, or the twentieth. Someone might figure it out.” She felt suddenly cold, pulling away from Marcus to rub her arms. He put a hand on her back and led her gently inside.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We have plenty of other things to worry about,” he said, uncharacteristically somber. “There was another Voice attack while you were gone, a big one. They raided the kennels and killed or kidnapped almost every trained dog the Grid had. Now we can’t—”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira stopped and grabbed him by the arm, her heart pounding. “The kennels? Isn’t that where Saladin worked?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“The boy wonder,” Marcus nodded, “the youngest human on the planet. They took him when they took the dogs, and half the people working with him. It was a pretty big blow, psychologically. Without the dogs we can’t track the Voice through the wilderness anymore, but without Saladin … it’s like they came in, kicked a puppy, and stole a baby. A lot of people are calling for an all-out war.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Why would they do that?” asked Kira. “Obviously it was going to make people mad—it’s almost like they went out of their way to piss us off. It’s certainly not going to win them any new supporters. Maybe they’re trying to start a war?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“They might be holding him for ransom,” said Marcus. “He’s a pretty big bargaining chip, and they left a note.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“A note?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Well, technically they tagged the kennel with twenty feet of graffiti, but still. The message was clear, the same as it’s always been: ‘Repeal the Hope Act.’”</span></p>
<p class="bodytextSb"><span>Kira pushed her way through the plastic tunnel. “Good morning.” She said it without thinking, then paused, wondering why. When had she started to think of it as a person?</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The Partial, of course, said nothing. It didn’t even seem to react when it heard her, and Kira wondered if it was asleep. She crept closer, trying to stay as quiet as she could, but the Partial groaned and coughed, rolling his head to the side and spitting.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“What are you—” She froze.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The spit was red with blood.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira dropped her files and rushed to his side, gently lifting his head. His face was black with bruises and crusted blood.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Holy crap, what happened to you?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>He groaned again, slowly blinking his eyes open. “Blood.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Yeah,” said Kira, running to the cupboards to look for towels, “I can see you’re bleeding, but why? What happened?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>He didn’t say anything. He tilted his head, popping the joints in his neck, then held up his right arm; it moved about three inches before the restraint jerked it to a stop. He had been given a change of clothes, and Kira pulled back his sleeve to reveal an arm covered with thin lacerations, tender and pink. “They cut me.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira’s mouth dropped open in horror. “Who?” The horror turned to anger almost instantly. “Who was it? The guards? Doctors?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>He nodded slightly, and probed his mouth with his tongue, making sure all the teeth were still in place.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“That’s ridiculous,” said Kira, fuming. She stomped to the microscope, snarled, and stomped back. Everything she’d thought about doing, and rejected for being inhumane, someone else had come in and done. She shot a long, cold glance at one of the cameras, an unblinking eye that stared back without emotion. She wanted to smash it, but took a breath and forced herself to calm down. Getting angry wasn’t going to solve anything. <i>I’m trying to be the good guy here, but … is coddling the Partial really “good”? Would I be serving humanity better by testing his limits?</i> She walked to her desk and sat down, still staring straight ahead. <i>I don’t even know what to do</i>.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She hung her head, and while looking down she saw the crumpled rubber glove in the garbage can. The breath test—she still needed to find a way to isolate the Partial’s breath so she could search it for samples of the airborne RM. The Spore. She still hadn’t found a good way to do it. The rubber gloves would work, she was pretty sure, but only if the subject was willing. She glanced at the Partial, grim and silent on the table.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She stood, pulled out another rubber glove, and walked slowly to the table.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Do you have a name?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>The Partial eyed her carefully, that slow, studying look that made her feel like he was calculating everything about her.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Why do you want to know?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Because I’m tired of calling you ‘Partial.’”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>He studied her a moment longer, then smiled, slowly and warily. “Samm.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Samm,” said Kira. “I have to admit, I was expecting something more unusual.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“It has two <i>M</i>s.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Why two <i>M</i>s?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Because that’s what it said on my rucksack,” said Samm. “‘Sam M.’ I didn’t realize the <i>M</i> was for a last name: I was two days old; I’d never met anyone with a last name. I was just… Samm. I spelled it that way on a report, and it stuck.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira nodded and crouched down next to him. “Samm,” she said, “I know you have no reason to help me, no reason to do anything I say, but I want you to understand that this is very important. You guessed yesterday that RM is still a big concern for us, and you were right. Everything I’m doing here—everything we’re all doing—is to find a way to cure it. That’s why we were in Manhattan, because nothing we have left here on the island was giving us any answers. I don’t know if that’s important to you in any way, but it’s incredibly important to me. I’d give up my life to find a cure. Now I know this sounds weird, but I’m going to ask you a favor.” She paused, almost talking herself out of it, then held up the rubber glove. “Will you breathe into this?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>His eyebrow went up.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I need you to inflate it,” she explained. “That will allow me to isolate your breath sample and study it in the medicomp.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>He hesitated. “Tell me your name.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Why?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Because I’m tired of calling you ‘human.’”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She cocked her head, looking at him. Was that a joke? His voice was still as flat and unemotional as ever but there was something almost playful behind it. Was he reaching out to her? Testing her? Behind it all, that calm, calculating look never left his eyes. Whatever he was doing, he must have more than one reason for doing it. She pursed her lips, thinking, and decided to go along with it. “My name is Kira.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Then yes, Kira, I will inflate your rubber glove.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She held it to his lips, feeling his breath on her hand, then clamped it down tight while he blew strongly into the glove. It took a couple of tries to get the seal right, but soon she had a small breath sample and pinched the glove off tightly. “Thank you.” She put the glove in the medicomp sample bay, feeling only slightly ridiculous, then closed the chamber and started flicking through the screens. The scope began the long process of finding as many structures as it could, saving them for Kira to look at.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Almost immediately, a small message popped up in the corner of the screen—the scope had found a “partial match” to something in its database. Kira shook her head. <i>No pun intended, right, microscope?</i> A moment later another one popped up, then two more, then four more, partial match after partial match. Kira pulled up the image and found a bizarre protein construct, completely new and yet, like the scope said, very familiar. She peered closer. There were dozens of matches now, climbing swiftly toward the hundreds. Something in Samm’s breath looked very similar to—but not exactly like—the RM Blob. Kira’s fingers flew across the screen, magnifying the image, rotating it, pulling it apart. It was remarkably close to the blood-borne version of RM—a similar size, a similar shape, even some of the same nodes and receptors on the surface. It wasn’t exactly RM, but it was close enough to make Kira shiver. The few small differences were the most terrifying part, because they meant it was new. A new strain of the virus, perhaps.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>And Samm was breathing it out.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira looked up at the ceiling, moving her eyes from corner to corner. She thought about calling out, or just running out of the room, but she paused. <i>I need to think this through</i>. First of all, she wasn’t sick; she had no symptoms, no discomfort, no signs of any pathogenic attack. She peered closer at the screen, studying the object: It looked like RM, but it didn’t look like a virus. A virus would have a core particle in its center, a little packet of genetic information that entered a host cell and corrupted it, but the thing in Samm’s breath didn’t have one. She searched it carefully, using her fingers to peel back the layers of the image, examining the structure in detail. As nearly as she could tell, this new particle didn’t have any way of reproducing itself. It was like a nonvirus version of the virus.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Whatever it was, the thing had given Kira something to concentrate on. She cross-referenced the image with the others in the database, searching for any sign of its purpose or function. Two possibilities immediately suggested themselves, and she jotted them down on her notepad: first, that Samm’s body could, at one time, produce the Blob, and that somehow that ability had been removed or reduced, leaving only this inert, nonviral structure. It was a vestigial particle, like the human appendix: the evidence of a previous function. Kira thought about that, staring at her notepad. Is this how the Partials spread RM? Did they just breathe it out and kill everyone? But then how did that function go away—what flipped the switch and made the deadly virus turn inert? <i>The Partials are engineered</i>, she thought. <i>A switch like that, and the power to flip it on and off, could have been built right into them. But who holds the key to flipping it?</i></span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira shuddered, the ramifications twisting her stomach into queasy knots. And yet her second guess about the particle seemed even worse: that the particle in Samm’s breath was a precursor to the active virus, designed to transform on contact with human blood and become the deadly Blob. Was that the secret of Partial immunity? A virus that couldn’t even arm itself until it found a human target? That was the worst possible situation for Kira, because it meant there might be nothing she could use—no defensive mechanism she could copy from the Partials to help fight off the virus. If RM targeted humans, specifically and directly, then the only defense against it was to not be human anymore.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Maybe the only way to survive was to be a Partial.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira shook her head, throwing down her notepad and shoving the thought from her mind. She couldn’t think like this—she <i>wouldn’t</i> think like this. There had to be something in the Partial genetic code that rendered RM inert, and there had to be a way to copy it and apply it to the human genetic code. And she was going to find it. The only thing this proved for certain was that what Samm had said yesterday was true: The Partials did have a connection to RM, at a very basic level. But what was it?</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She tapped on the screen, opening the particle’s profile information to give it a name. The blood-borne form was the Blob, because it was fat; the airborne was the Spore, because it was, presumably, how the virus spread. This new one she labeled the Lurker, because it didn’t have any obvious function at all. It simply sat and waited, presumably, for the right time to strike.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“You’re not going to find what you’re looking for.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Kira started again; Samm had a funny sense of timing. But she was curious. “And how do you know what I’m looking for?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“You’re looking for a solution.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I’m looking for a cure.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“The cure is only part of it,” said Samm. “You’re looking for a solution to your problems: rebels, plagues, political unrest, civil war. You’re scared of everything, and to be fair, everything in your lives is pretty scary. You’re looking for a way to move past it, to bring your lives back together. But you’re not going to find the answers simply by curing RM. And you know it.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span><i>He’s been listening to us</i>, thought Kira. <i>A lot of that he could have picked up from the hearing, but not all of it. Not the Voice, certainly. But he’s been paying attention, and he’s figured it out</i>. Her first thought was to stop talking, to make sure the Partial couldn’t glean any more info. And yet, he was tied up and had four days to live. How could deducing an impending civil war possibly help him to escape?</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She felt trapped in the room and marched past Samm to open the window for air. It wouldn’t budge. She strained against it as hard as she could, muttering curses at the Senate for locking her in, then remembered that this was ostensibly a sealed room, and felt stupid for even trying to open the window, which only made her curse more harshly.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“We don’t want you to die,” said Samm.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Then why did you kill us?” Kira whirled to face him, feeling her face grow hot and red.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“I told you, we didn’t create RM.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“What I found in your breath suggests otherwise.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>If that was news to Samm, he didn’t show it. “If we wanted you dead, you would be dead,” said Samm. “That’s not a threat, it’s a fact.”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Then what do you want from us?” Kira demanded. “Why did you keep us alive? What are you planning? Is this why you were in Manhattan?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>He hesitated for a moment. “You seem like you’d do anything to ensure humanity’s survival. How far are you willing to go?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“What are you talking about?” she asked. “What are you suggesting?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>He glanced at the corner, to a camera she knew was watching and listening to everything they said. He closed his mouth and looked at the ceiling.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“No,” said Kira, leaning over him, “you can’t just say something like that and then clam up again. Why did you even start talking if you’re not going to finish?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>He didn’t answer; he didn’t even look at her.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>“Is this what you were talking about yesterday? That you can’t tell us because you don’t want to die? I’ve got news for you, Samm: You’re going to die anyway. If you’ve got something to say, say it. You were in Manhattan for a reason; are you saying it had something to do with RM?”</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>She waited there for a full minute, but he stayed silent, and she turned angrily back to the window, slamming the pane with her hand. The sound of the slam echoed back, but distantly. <i>That was weird</i>. She frowned, peering at the window, and hit it again, wondering what had caused the sound. Nothing happened. She leaned in closer, and suddenly a loud string of rapid pops drifted in from the city beyond. She looked out, trying to see what the noise could possibly be, and saw a plume of smoke rise up from somewhere beyond the trees. It couldn’t have been more than a few blocks away. The popping continued, short bursts of rapid, rhythmic noise, but it wasn’t until she saw people running that she realized what it was.</span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>Automatic gunfire. The city was under attack.</span></p>
